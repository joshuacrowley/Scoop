# Scoop

My first web app. A HTML snippet generator to automate/augment a clunky workflow, due to an aging Content Managment System. Uses Opengraph tags to scrape links and metadata and maps the content to various html templates.

Saved many, many hours of intern's time and also helped reduced errors in our content.
